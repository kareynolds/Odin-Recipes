# Odin-Recipes
This project is designed to show case knowledge of basic HTML. It will list various recipes using ordered and unordered lists, and link to external sites as well as internal pages. To start with it should be very basic. The goal of this is also to practice with using Git commits. 

When enough changes have occurred open terminal git add (file name) 
Then git commit file name. Check the status with git log prior to committing to ensure the file is staged. Once the file is staged git commit and type a message under source control panel. Keep the subject less less than 50 characters, do not add a . at the end. double space then add more detail as needed.
